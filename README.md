# Telco Customer Churn Reduction

## Project Description
Telco wants you to find what drives customer churn at the company. Churn is defined as the rate at which customers leave a company. We know that new customer acquisition can cost five times more than retaining an existing customer. We also know that increasing customer retention by 5% can increase profits from 25-95%. Therefore, it is important to determine and target what is causing the largest source of churn, so that the company can reduce it. 

## Objectives
- Find the drivers for customer churn at Telco.
- Construct a model to predict customer churn using classifcation techniques.
- Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploration and testing, modeling, and evaluating, and findings and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook report.
- Present a high-level notebook walkthrough targeted to your audience.
- Answer panel questions about your code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.

## Goals
- Find drivers for customer churn.
- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
- Create modules that make your process repeateable.
- Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report.

## Audience
- Your target audience for your notebook walkthrough is the Codeup Data Science team. This should guide your language and level of explanations in your walkthrough.

## Project Planning
### Data Science Pipeline:
- Planning
- Acquisition
- Preparation
- Exploration
- Modeling 
- Delivery 

## Hypothesis
- The largest source of churn is coming from month-to-month contracts because of increasing monthly charges. Specifically, the phone and internet bundle customers are churning the most. 

## Key Findings 
- Internet customers are increasingly paying more over time
- Remember that customer will not switch backwards to DSL
