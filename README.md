# Telco Churn Project

## Project Description
Telco wants you to find what drives customer churn at the company. Churn is the rate at which customers leave the company. It is important to determine where and why churn is happening so that the company can reduce churn. 

## Objectives
- Find the drivers for customer churn at Telco.
- Construct a model to predict customer churn using classifcation techniques.
- Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploration and testing, modeling, and evaluating, and findings and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook report.
- Present a high-level notebook walkthrough targeted to your audience.
- Answer panel questions about your code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.

## Goals
- Find drivers for customer churn.
- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
- Create modules that make your process repeateable.
- Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report.

## Audience
- Your target audience for your notebook walkthrough is the Codeup Data Science team. This should guide your language and level of explanations in your walkthrough.
