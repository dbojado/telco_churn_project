- Present a high-level notebook walkthrough targeted to your audience.
- Answer panel questions about your code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.

# Goals

- Find drivers for customer churn.
- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
- Create modules that make your process repeateable.
- Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report.

# Audience
- Your target audience for your notebook walkthrough is the Codeup Data Science team. This should guide your language and level of explanations in your walkthrough.
